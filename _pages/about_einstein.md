Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

<!-- ### Practical notes for maintaining this site (keep these instructions)

- **Profile photo:** Place your photo in the appropriate image folder (commonly `assets/img/` or `img/`, depending on the template) and set the filename in the YAML header of this file. By default, the template expects:
  - `prof_pic.jpg`  
  Then update the YAML field `profile.image` accordingly.

- **Address / contact block:** The text shown under your photo is controlled by the `profile.more-info` field in the YAML header of `_pages/about.md`. You can edit or disable that section by modifying the `profile` settings in the YAML front matter.

- **Publications page:** Update your BibTeX file:
  - `_bibliography/papers.bib`  
  Jekyll will automatically render the publications page using the entries in this file.

- **Social links:** The theme supports **Font Awesome** and **Academicons**. You can enable, disable, or update social links (e.g., Google Scholar, LinkedIn) via the site configuration and/or author/profile settings used by your template.
