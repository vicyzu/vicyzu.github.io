The **Vision and Intelligent Computing (VIC)** Lab is a research laboratory within the Department of Electrical Engineering, dedicated to advancing fundamental and applied research in computer vision, multimedia processing, artificial intelligence (AI), and intelligent computing. Our research emphasizes the principled integration of image, video, and audio understanding with modern deep learning architectures, representation learning, and intelligent systems design.

**Our mission** is to design intelligent, efficient, and scalable AI-driven solutions that address critical challenges across a wide range of application domains, including healthcare analytics, geoscience and environmental monitoring, human–computer interaction, and autonomous and intelligent systems. We place strong emphasis on real-world deployability, generalization across domains, and interpretability of AI models.

The VIC Lab actively collaborates with international academic institutions, industrial partners, and interdisciplinary research communities. Through these collaborations, we aim to bridge the gap between fundamental research and real-world impact, fostering innovation that contributes to both scientific advancement and societal needs.
